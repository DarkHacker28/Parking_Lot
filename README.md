This project is a simple **Parking Lot Management System** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The application allows users to park cars, generate tickets, and manage parking spots efficiently.

## Features

- **Generate Ticket**: A unique ticket is generated for each parked car with essential details.
- **Retrieve Car**: Users can retrieve their car by entering the ticket information.
- **Manage Parking Spots**: The system tracks available parking spots dynamically.

## Technologies Used
